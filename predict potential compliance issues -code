Use Case:  predict potential compliance issues based on historical compliance data.
Let's say we have a dataset where each row represents an event or transaction, with various attributes (features) and a label indicating whether it was compliant (0) or non-compliant (1). We'll use a logistic regression model for this binary classification task, as it's a straightforward yet effective choice for binary outcomes.

Step 1: Import Libraries
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
Step 2: Load and Inspect the Dataset
Assuming the dataset is in a CSV file named compliance_data.csv.

python
Copy code
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('compliance_data.csv')

# Inspect the first few rows
print(df.head())
Step 3: Data Preprocessing
This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if necessary, and splitting the dataset into features (X) and the target label (y).

python
Copy code
# Assume 'compliant' is the target variable
X = df.drop('compliant', axis=1)  # Features
y = df['compliant']                # Target variable

# Split the dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
Step 4: Train the Model
python
Copy code
# Initialize and train the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
Step 5: Model Evaluation
python
Copy code
# Predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Evaluate the model
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
This code provides a basic framework for building a predictive analytics model. However, in real-world scenarios, especially for regulatory compliance, you'd need to perform more complex data preprocessing, explore different models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines), conduct hyperparameter tuning, and possibly use techniques to handle imbalanced datasets if there's a significant discrepancy between compliant and non-compliant instances.

Remember, the effectiveness of a predictive analytics model greatly depends on the quality and relevance of the data, as well as the appropriateness of the chosen model to the specific characteristics of the data and the problem at hand.
